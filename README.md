# Technical Interview Practice with LeetCode

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions and notes as I practice for technical interviews using LeetCode problems. Here, I work through coding challenges, algorithms, and data structures to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for upcoming interviews.

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of core computer science concepts
- Practice solving algorithmic and data structure problems from LeetCode
- Document solutions and approaches for future reference

## Contents

- LeetCode problem statements
- Solution code
- Explanations and insights
